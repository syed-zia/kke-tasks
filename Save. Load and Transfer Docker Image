One of the DevOps team members was working on to create a new custom docker image on App Server 1 in Stratos DC. 
He is done with his changes and image is saved on same server with name official:xfusion. 
Recently a requirement has been raised by a team to use that image for testing, but the team wants to test the same on App Server 3. 
So we need to provide them that image on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.


a. On App Server 1 save the image official:xfusion in an archive.

b. Transfer the image archive to App Server 3.

c. Load that image archive on App Server 3 with same name and tag which was used on App Server 1.

Note: Docker is already installed on both servers; however, if its service is down please make sure to start it.

==============
solution:
==========

a. to check the version 
   # docker --version
   to check the images on the app server1
   # docker images 
   to save the image 
   # sudo docker save --output official.tar official:xfusion
   to check the archive is availabe on app server 1
   # ls -lh
b. to transfer the image to app server 3
   # sudo scp official.tar banner@stapp03:/home/banner
c. to load the images on app server 3
   # sudo docker load --input official.tar
d. to check the status and start the docker and container service

to check status:
sudo systemctl status docker.service
sudo systemctl status containerd.service

to start:
sudo systemctl start docker.service
sudo systemctl start containerd.service

and check the status again after firing the above commands.
sudo systemctl status docker.service
sudo systemctl status containerd.service
