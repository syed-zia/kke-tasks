 The Nautilus application development team shared static website content that needs to be hosted on the httpd web server using a containerized platform. 
 The team has shared details with the DevOps team, and we need to set up an environment according to those guidelines. 
 Below are the details:


a. On App Server 2 in Stratos DC create a container named httpd using a docker compose file /opt/docker/docker-compose.yml (please use the exact name for file).

b. Use httpd (preferably latest tag) image for container and make sure container is named as httpd; you can use any name for service.

c. Map 80 number port of container with port 8084 of docker host.

d. Map container's /usr/local/apache2/htdocs volume with /opt/finance volume of docker host which is already there. (please do not modify any data within these locations).

Tips:

Dockerfile vs Docker-Compose:

A Dockerfile is a simple text file that contains the commands a user could call to assemble an image
whereas Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

Docker Compose define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment. 
It get an app running in one command by just running docker-compose up.
Docker compose uses the Dockerfile if one add the build command to your projectâ€™s docker-compose.yml. 
Your Docker workflow should be to build a suitable Dockerfile for each image you wish to create, then use compose to assemble the images using the build command.
