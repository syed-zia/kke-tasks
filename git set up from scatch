Some new developers have joined xFusionCorp Industries and have been assigned Nautilus project.
They are going to start development on a new application, and some pre-requisites have been shared with the DevOps team to proceed with. 
Please note that all tasks need to be performed on storage server in Stratos DC.


a. Install git, set up any values for user.email and user.name globally and create a bare repository /opt/blog.git.

b. There is an update hook (to block direct pushes to master branch) under /tmp on storage server itself; 
use the same to block direct pushes to master branch in /opt/blog.git repo.

c. Clone /opt/blog.git repo in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog directory.

d. Create a new branch xfusioncorp_blog in repo that you cloned in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos.

e. There is a readme.md file in /tmp on storage server itself; copy that to repo, add/commit in the new branch you created, and finally push your branch to origin.

f. Also create master branch from your branch and remember you should not be able to push to master as per hook you have set up.

Solution:
--------
Here are all the steps, please change it the name slightly depending on what you get.

sudo git init --bare blog.git
sudo cp /tmp/update blog.git/hooks/.

Task c:
cd /opt 
sudo git clone blog.git /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog

Task d:
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog
sudo git checkout -b xfusioncorp_blog

Task e:
sudo cp /tmp/readme.md . 
sudo git add --all 
sudo git commit -m "add readme" 
sudo git push origin xfusioncorp_blog

Task f:
sudo git checkout -b master 
sudo touch test-file 
sudo git add --all 
sudo git commit -m "test if master can checkin" 
sudo git push origin master # it should fail if you have set up as per the task requirement
