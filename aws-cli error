Issue : AWS CLI: SSL Validation Failed 
Description: when you attempt to connect to AWS account using AWS CLI, especially when trying to list the s3 buckets etc.

Resolution:



SSL validation failed for <endpoint_url> [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed

To workaround the issue you can add the --no-verify-ssl option to the AWS CLI:

$ aws s3 ls --no-verify-ssl
But this is not secure and will cause the following warning:

InsecureRequestWarning: Unverified HTTPS request is being made.
Adding certificate verification is strongly advised. See: https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced-usage.html#ssl-warnings




This can be done by setting the AWS_CA_BUNDLE environment variable.

Linux:
$ export AWS_CA_BUNDLE="/data/ca-certs/ca-bundle.pem"



$ nano ~/aws/.config
$ cat ~/aws/.config
[default]
ca_bundle = /data/ca-certs/ca-bundle.pem
