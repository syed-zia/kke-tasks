The Nautilus DevOps team is testing applications containerization, which issupposed to be migrated on docker container-based environments soon. 
In today's stand-up meeting one of the team members has been assigned a task to create and test a docker container with certain requirements.
Below are more details:


a. On App Server 3 in Stratos DC pull ubuntu image (preferably latest tag but others should work too).

b. Create a new container with name news from the image you just pulled.

c. Map the host volume /opt/security with container volume /var. There is an sample.txt file present on same server under /tmp; 
copy that file to /opt/security. Also please keep the container in running state.


solution:
( need to check the solution once)

sudo docker run -d  --name news -v /opt/security:/var -t ubuntu:latest 

copying the file 

sudo cp /tmp/sample.txt /opt/security/. 

to login to container

sudo docker exec -it news /bin/bash 

to verify the file is available on mount 

cd /var ; ls -ltr sample*
