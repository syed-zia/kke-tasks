New packages need to be installed on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. 
The Nautilus DevOps team has decided to install the same using Puppet. 
Since jump host is already configured to run as Puppet master server and all app servers are already configured to work as puppet agent nodes, 
we need to create required manifests on the Puppet master server so that the same can be applied on all Puppet agent nodes. 
Please find more details about the task below.


Create a Puppet programming file games.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on master node 
i.e Jump Server and using puppet package resource perform the tasks below.

Install package httpd through Puppet package resource on all Puppet agent nodes i.e all App Servers.
Note: Please perform this task using games.pp only, do not create any separate inventory file.

Solution:
==========
step 1:

    cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests
    ls -ltr
    vi games.pp 
    
node default {
 # This is where you can declare classes for all nodes.
package { httpd: ensure => installed; }
}


puppet parser validate games.pp # validate the syntax
puppet apply games.pp # to apply the changes
    

carry out the below steps on all the 3 appservers

[banner@stapp03 ~]$ history
    1  sudo systemctl status httpd # to check if httpd is installed, result will be false
    2  sudo puppet agent -t
    3  sudo systemctl status httpd # this time you will get output
    4  history
