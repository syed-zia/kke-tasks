The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to host an application on a nginx-based container. There are number of tickets already been created for similar tasks. One of the tickets has been assigned to set up a nginx container on Application Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. Please perform the task as per details mentioned below:



a. Pull nginx:stable docker image on Application Server 1.

b. Create a container named ecommerce using the image you pulled.

c. Map host port 8081 to container port 80. Please keep the container in running state.





Solution :

ssh into stapp01 --> ssh tony@stapp01
switch user -->  sudo su -

[root@stapp01 ~]# history
    1  docker pull nginx:stable --> to pull the image on the stapp01 server
    2  docker images --> to list the images
    3  docker ps --> to check the container running , initially there will nothing running
    4  docker container run -d --name ecommerce -p 8081:80 nginx:stable
    5  docker images
    6  docker ps. --> it will container now
