On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes, 
which is degrading the performance of the server. Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. 
Please set its maximum process limits as below:


a. soft limit = 75

b. hard_limit = 96

solution:

– To view soft limits, use the below command:

# ulimit -u -S
– Similarly, to view hard limits, use the below command:

# ulimit -u -H

set the limit in the file:

# cat /etc/security/limits.conf | grep nproc | grep -v ^#
test hard nproc 2047
test soft nproc 16384
