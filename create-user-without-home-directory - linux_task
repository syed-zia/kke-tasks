The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up a new tool on all app servers, as they have a requirement to create a service user account that will 
be used by that tool. They are finished with all apps except for App 1 in Stratos Datacenter.

Task 1 - Create a user named ammar in App Server 1 without a home directory.

Solution:
 
 to create the user ammar 
 
 login to the box and fire the below command:
 
 useradd -M ammar
 
 to verify, you should see an entry : 
 cat /etc/passwd | grep ammar
