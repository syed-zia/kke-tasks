There are directory structures in the Stratos Datacenter that need to be changed, including directories that need to be linked to the default Apache document root.
We need to accomplish this task using only Puppet as per the instructions given below:


Create a puppet programming file blog.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on puppet master node i.e on Jump Server. 
Within that define a class symlink and perform below mentioned tasks:

Create a symbolic link through puppet programming code. The source path should be /opt/data and destination path should be /var/www/html on all Puppet agents i.e on all App Servers.

Create a blank file blog.txt under /opt/data directory on all puppet agent nodes i.e on all App Servers.

Note: Please perform this task using blog.pp only, do not create any separate inventory file.


Solution
==========

create a beta.pp with below content
root@jump_host /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests# cat beta.pp 
class symlink {

  file { '/opt/itadmin':
     ensure => 'link',
     target => '/var/www/html',
  }
  file { '/opt/itadmin/story.txt':
     ensure  => 'present',
     replace => 'no', # this is the important property
  }
}

node 'stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com','stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com','stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com'{ 
include symlink
}

node default{
}  


On master puppet server as root
    9  puppet parser validate beta.pp # to check the syntax of the file beta.pp without executing code
   12  puppet apply -v --noop beta.pp # to execute the code but without making the changes / permanent
   13  puppet apply beta.pp # to apply the changes and execute the code
   
on the rest of the app servers , node servers, run as sudo 
[steve@stapp02 itadmin]$ history
    1  sudo puppet agent -tv
