On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes, which is degrading the performance of the server. 
Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. 
Please set its maximum process limits as below:
a. soft limit = 77
b. hard_limit = 98

Solution:

1. Setting nproc hard/soft limits permanently,  need to edit in below file:
 vi /etc/security/limits.conf
 nfsuser soft nproc 79 ( for user)
 nfsuser hard nproc 91

2. for group, you need to use @ 
@nfsuer ( @ is required infront for groups)

3. to validate after add
cat /etc/security/limits.conf | grep nproc | grep -v ^#

or

su - nfsuser
ulimit -u -S
ulimit -u –H

– To view soft limits, use the below command:
# ulimit -u -S
– Similarly, to view hard limits, use the below command:
# ulimit -u -H
