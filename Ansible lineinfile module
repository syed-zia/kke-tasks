The Nautilus DevOps team want to install and set up a simple httpd web server on all app servers in Stratos DC. They also want to deploy a sample web page using Ansible only. Therefore, prepare the required playbook to complete this task. Find more details about the task below.


We already have an inventory file under /home/thor/ansible on jump host. Create a playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible on jump host itself.

Using the playbook install httpd web server on all app servers, and make sure its service is up and running.

Create a file /var/www/html/index.html with content:

This is a Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!

Using lineinfile Ansible module add some more content in /var/www/html/index.html file. Below is the content:
Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!

Also make sure this new line is added at the top of the file.

The /var/www/html/index.html file's user and group owner should be apache on all app servers.

The /var/www/html/index.html file's permissions should be 0655 on all app servers.

Note: Validation will try to run playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.

Solution:
List of files under /home/thor/ansible:
thor@jump_host ~/ansible$ ls -ltr
total 8
-rw-r--r-- 1 thor thor 237 Feb 15 16:37 inventory
-rw-r--r-- 1 thor thor  36 Feb 15 16:37 ansible.cfg

thor@jump_host ~/ansible$ cat in*
stapp01 ansible_host=xxx.xx.xx.xx ansible_ssh_pass=xxxx ansible_user=xxx
stapp02 ansible_host=xxx.xx.xx.xx ansible_ssh_pass=xxxx ansible_user=xxx
stapp03 ansible_host=xxx.xx.xx.xx ansible_ssh_pass=xxxx ansible_user=xxxx

thor@jump_host ~/ansible$ cat a*
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False

To verify without creating/deploying changes:
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml --check
