The Nautilus DevOps team was auditing some of the applications running on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter.
They found some security loopholes-for example, they observed that there is no firewall installed on these apps. 
So, the team has decided to install firewalld on all App Servers. Some rules need to be added.
This task needs to be done using Puppet; please complete the task per the following details:


Create an inventory file data.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on Puppet master node i.e on Jump Server.
In this inventory file you need to define node specific classes only which are mentioned below.

Define a class firewall_node1 for agent node 1 i.e App Server 1, firewall_node2 for agent node 2 i.e App Server 2, firewall_node3 and for agent node3 i.e App Server 3.
Also create a Puppet programming file demo.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on Puppet master node i.e on Jump Server 
and write code to perform the following task.

Install puppet firewall module on master node i.e on Jump Server (you can install manually).

There are some different applications running on all three apps. One of the applications is using port 8081 on App server 1 , 
5008 on App server 2 and 8096 on App server 3. Complete below mentioned tasks:

a. Open all incoming connections for 8081/tcp port on App Server 1 and zone should be public.

b. Open all incoming connections for 5008/tcp port on App Server 2 and zone should be public.

c. Open all incoming connections for 8096/tcp port on App Server 3 and zone should be public.

Note: Please do not add firewall rich rules.


Solution:


1. To navigate to directory 

cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests

2. Install module puppet

puppet module install puppet-firewalld --version 4.4.0

3. validate

puppet parser validate beta.pp
puppet parser validate data.pp

4. Execute the files

puppet apply data.pp
puppet apply beta.pp

5. on all the 4 app servers, execute the below

sudo puppet agent -tv

[banner@stapp03 ~]$ sudo puppet agent -tv

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
